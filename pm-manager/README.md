### Introduction

Welcome this is an alpha package for the PM Manager Addon.

The PM Manager is a user manageable global private message blocker for KVIrc.
The PM Manager has a simple UI to whitelist users temporarily or permanently, or
via a simple context menu entry.

The PM Manager notifies you and blocked users of any blocked PMs by default and
allows you in addition to the pre-configured default message, to configure your
own personalized notification message to send to users instead.

### Todo

Still need to do up info/help files.

Notes
We recommend you add any command bots you use to the whitelist.

### Install

Once you have extracted the package.
* Via the scripting Menu Entry and select `Execute Script`
* Via ```Ctrl+Shift+X``` navigate to location you extracted the addon
  then select the ```install.kvs`` file and click open.
