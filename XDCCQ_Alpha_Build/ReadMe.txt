XDCCQ Alpha Build 2017

Well here's what I have so far.
Redesinged most of the GUI's and added several new ones.
Have also builtin a check if user is in both #mg-chat & #moviegods channels, if not it turns off the QLoader.

This version will not work with the existing Ninja Announcer, I'm changing it over to Addon as well.
So it will work once both are Addon's.

Give it a try and let me know what you think.

Enjoy :)
